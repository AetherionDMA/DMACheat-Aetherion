## 🛠️ How Does It Work?
DMA (Direct Memory Access) allows external hardware to read a computer's memory without direct intervention from the operating system or software. This technique is commonly used for hardware-assisted cheats in gaming, enabling undetectable data extraction and manipulation.

## 🔧 Component Overview:

### 🎮 Gaming PC (Left)
The primary machine where the game is running.

### 💻 Second PC/Laptop (Right)
A secondary system that runs the cheat software and processes game data.

### 📡 DMA Card
- Connected via PCI-Express to the Gaming PC.
- Reads memory directly without triggering anti-cheat detections.

### 🎮 KmBox (Keyboard & Mouse Emulator)
- A hardware device that mimics human-like keyboard and mouse inputs.
- Used for aimbot, triggerbot, and other automated actions.

### 📺 Fuser (HDMI/DP)
- Intercepts the video output signal.
- Overlays ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) information, such as wallhacks and radar, onto the gaming display.

## ⚙️ How It Works:
1. **Memory Extraction**: The Second PC extracts real-time game data from the Gaming PC using the DMA Card.
2. **Cheat Processing**: The cheat software running on the Second PC interprets and processes the extracted data to calculate ESP, aimbot, and other functionalities.
3. **Command Injection**: Inputs are sent to the Gaming PC through the KmBox, simulating legitimate keyboard and mouse actions to avoid detection.
4. **Visual Overlay**: The Fuser intercepts the HDMI/DP signal from the Gaming PC and overlays ESP elements (such as enemy locations) onto the display without modifying the game software.
